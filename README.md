# Cyclistic-s-Case-Study
Google data analyst certificate capstone project

Welcome to my first project (yay! \o/)

* Original data files used in this project can be found here: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

***Data collected from Feb/2021 to Jan/2022. == Data made available by Motivate International Inc. 
under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

* Replicating the entire process with Rmarkdown requires downloading the specific data files from the link provided in this readme
  and running the created code chunks.
* Data set files were not uploaded due to size limitations (25Mb)

- Data was gathered, cleaned and analysed to find out more about Cyclistic's userbase.
- A comparison on causal and subscription members product usage. (see Number_of_rides_by_weekday.jpeg).
- The final data set created should be usefull for future marketing campaigns aimed on converting casual to membership users.
  

This is not only a capstone project but an ongoing learning process.

Special thanks to all the people who gave me the strength to evolve in these difficult times. 
You guys are the best.
